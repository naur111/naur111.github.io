        <h1>Welcome to Naureen's Virtual Art Show</h1>

        <div class="description">
            <p>This virtual art gallery is a collection of works inspired by the evil eye also known as "nazar". In middle eastern and islamic culture, the concept of evil eye is a belief that other individuals have the power to cause harm on others by looking at them in a jealous or envious manner. The three art works explore themes of karma and sight. </p>
